I am a senior application engineer at <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/">MathWorks</a> in the computational biology group focussed on Simbiology and bioinformatics. I am mostly interested in the intersection of biology, computation, modeling (statistical and first principle) and artifical intelligence. Before pivoting to industry, I had obtained a PhD at the University of California San Diego under the supervision of <a href="http://stokeslet.ucsd.edu/index.html">Prof. David Saintillan</a> in computational biophysics to understand how genome organizes insid the cell. 

I leverage interdisciplinary skills including computational biophysics, numerical analysis, algorithm development, applied mathematics, data science and high performance computing to address large scale complex biological problems.

Prior to coming to UCSD, I have obtained an M.S.(Engg). degree from Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (Bangalore, India) and a B.Tech. degree in Chemical Engineering from National Institute of Technology Karnataka Surathkal.
