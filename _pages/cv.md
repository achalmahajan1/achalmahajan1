<h2>EDUCATION</h2>
* **July 2021 (expected)**: Ph.D. (Engineering Phys.) \| _University of California, San Diego_
* **2016**: M.S. \| _Jawaharlal Nehru Center for Advanced Scientic Research_, _Bangalore_
* **2013**: B.Tech. Chemical Engineering \| _National Institute of Technology Karnataka Surathkal_

<h2>RESEARCH EXPERIENCE</h2>
* **2016-ongoing**: Graduate student researcher (Advisor: Prof. David Saintillan)
  Dissertation : From nano to micro: activity-driven self-organization of interphase chromatin
  * Leading a collaboration between 3 labs on a government operating grant worth $300k to build and
test physical models to explain the phenomenon of chromatin organization inside the cell nucleus by
using ideas of fuid-polymer dynamics that resulted in gaining new insight. In the process of preparing
multiple first author publications to be submitted in leading journals.
  * Developed a highly scalable Stokes flow solver to understand the leading to a reduction in the simulation
run time by 60%. As a direct result of my team's successes I was awarded additional computational
time with the opportunity to work on a bigger project.
  * Performed analysis of multidimensional large content data sets using MATLAB and python; designed
theoretical and computational models to capture experimental observations with Fortran and C system-
atically scaled to run on a supercomputer by engaging with molecular biologists and mathematicians.

* **2013-2016**: Graduate masters student (Advisor: Prof. Meheboob Alam)
 Thesis: Two problems on granular flows - Poiseuille and Taylor-Couette flows
  * Led a successful research project towards developing computational tools to understand the role of
dissipation and rarefaction in hydrodynamics of granular flows.
  * Managed two independent projects aimed at improving the theoretical understanding of granular 
flow instabilities in different model configurations.
  * Performed analysis of multidimensional large content data sets using MATLAB and Python.

* **May 2012-July 2012**: Summer Internship, Dept. of Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (Supervisor Professor V. Kumaran)
 Title : Rheological properties of soft walled tubes and flow transition at lower Reynolds number
  * An experimental setup was fabricated to study the transition of flow from laminar to turbulent through a viscoelastic micro channel.
  * Experiments were first to show that a flexible rectangular channel made of polydimethysiloxane (PDMS)
induce an instability in the flow, and pushes the transition reynolds number to as low as âˆ¼ 500.
  * Coupling between the fluid stresses and elastic stresses in the wall was found to be responsible for the
onset of instabilities in the flow.
* **2010-2011**: Undergraduate Research Assistant (Advisor: Prof. Vidya K Shetty)
  * Carried out experimental studies of oxygen mass transfer rate into a carboxyl methyl-cellulose (CMC)
solution in a pulsating plate column.
  * Investigated the effect of frequency of pulsation, amplitude of pulsation and velocity of air on volumetric
mass transfer coefficient for oxygen into CMC solutions of different concentrations.

<h2>AWARDS AND ACHIEVEMENTS</h2>

* **2018-2020** Awarded service units (SUs) worth $21,698.20 on San Diego Super Computer (Comet) under the Xsede
research allocation program funded by National Science Foundation (NSF).
* **2019** MAE Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award, Department of MAE, UCSD.
* **2016** Jacobs Fellow, UCSD by Jacobs school of Engineering.
* **2016** Best M.S. (Engg) Thesis Award in Engineering Mechanics (R. Narasimha Award).
* **2013** Junior Research Fellowship (JRF) awarded for graduate studies in India.
* **2012** Summer Research Outreach Programme fellowship by Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore as
a scholarship to carry out three months of research.
* **2007** Merit scholarship and best outgoing student award for outstanding performance in the All
India Secondary School Examination (AISSE).
