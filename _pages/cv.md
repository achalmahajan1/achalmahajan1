<h2>Education</h2>
* **2021 (expected)**: Ph.D. (Engineering Phys.) \| _University of California, San Diego_
* **2016**: M.S. \| _Jawaharlal Nehru Center for Advanced Scientic Research_
* **2013**: B.Tech. Chemical Engineering \| _National Institute of Technology Karnataka Surathkal of Virginia_

<h2>Work Experience</h2>
* **2016-ongoing**: Graduate student researcher - Advisor: Prof. David Saintillan
  * Leading a collaboration between 3 labs on a government operating grant worth $300k to build and
test physical models to explain the phenomenon of chromatin organization inside the cell nucleus by
using ideas of fuid-polymer dynamics that resulted in gaining new insight. In the process of preparing
multiple first author publications to be submitted in leading journals.
  * Developed a highly scalable Stokes flow solver to understand the leading to a reduction in the simulation
run time by 60%. As a direct result of my team's successes I was awarded additional computational
time with the opportunity to work on a bigger project.
  * Performed analysis of multidimensional large content data sets using MATLAB and python; designed
theoretical and computational models to capture experimental observations with Fortran and C system-
atically scaled to run on a supercomputer by engaging with molecular biologists and mathematicians.
* **2013-2016**: Graduate masters student- Advisor: Prof Meheboob Alam
  * Led a successful research project towards developing computational tools to understand the role of
  dissipation and rarefaction in hydrodynamics of granular flows resulting in a publication.
  * Developed computational framework for 
* **20-2011**: Undergraduate Research Assistant - Advisor: Prof. Vidya K Shetty
  * Carried out experimental studies of oxygen mass transfer rate into a carboxyl methyl-cellulose (CMC)
solution in a pulsating plate column.
  * Investigated the effect of frequency of pulsation, amplitude of pulsation and velocity of air on volumetric
mass transfer coefficient for oxygen into CMC solutions of different concentrations.
