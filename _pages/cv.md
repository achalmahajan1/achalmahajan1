<h2>EDUCATION</h2>
* **July 2021 (expected)**: Ph.D. (Engineering Phys.) \| _University of California, San Diego_
* **2016**: M.S. \| _Jawaharlal Nehru Center for Advanced Scientic Research_, _Bangalore_
* **2013**: B.Tech. Chemical Engineering \| _National Institute of Technology Karnataka Surathkal_

<h2>Work experience</h2>
* **2022-Current**: Senior Application Engineer/Scientist, MathWorks
* 
* **2016-2021 **: Graduate student researcher (Advisor: Prof. David Saintillan)

  # Dissertation : From nano to micro: activity-driven self-organization of interphase chromatin
  # * Technical project lead in computational biophysics for activity induced phase separation and coherent
# motion in interphase chromatin and DNA loop extrusion.
  # * Highly collaborative, and expertise in programming/data analysis resulted in 3 separate collaborations,
# each leading to co-authored publications in preparation.
  # * Creative problem solving skills and ability to plan and deliver with dedicated timelines. Organization,
# evaluation and analysis of modeling data to address performance and reliability.
  # * Developed and optimized computational pipeline to quantify the physical mechanism behind the en-
# hanced segregation of silent/active genomic regions by combining modeling and Hi-C data. 
  # * Facilitated the research group in creating valuable tools to improve their computational and data workflow as the labâ€™s computational consultant. Maintained a 10k+ line simulation codebase capable of running in high performance computing environment.
  # * Performed analysis of multidimensional large content data sets using MATLAB and python; designed
# theoretical and computational models to capture experimental observations with Fortran and C systematically scaled to run on a supercomputer by engaging with molecular biologists and mathematicians.

* **2013-2016**: Graduate masters student (Advisor: Prof. Meheboob Alam)

 # Thesis: Two problems on granular flows - Poiseuille and Taylor-Couette flows
  # * Led a successful research project towards developing computational tools to understand the role of
# dissipation and rarefaction in hydrodynamics of granular flows.
  # * Managed two independent projects aimed at improving the theoretical understanding of granular 
# flow instabilities in different model configurations.
  # * Performed analysis of multidimensional large content data sets using MATLAB and Python.

# * **May 2012-July 2012**: Summer Internship, Dept. of Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (Supervisor Professor V. Kumaran)
 # Title : Rheological properties of soft walled tubes and flow transition at lower Reynolds number
  # * An experimental setup was fabricated to study the transition of flow from laminar to turbulent through a viscoelastic micro channel.
  # * Experiments were first to show that a flexible rectangular channel made of polydimethysiloxane (PDMS)
# induce an instability in the flow, and pushes the transition reynolds number to as low as ~ 500.
 #  * Coupling between the fluid stresses and elastic stresses in the wall was found to be responsible for the
# onset of instabilities in the flow.
# * **2010-2011**: Undergraduate Research Assistant (Advisor: Prof. Vidya K Shetty)
  # * Carried out experimental studies of oxygen mass transfer rate into a carboxyl methyl-cellulose (CMC)
# solution in a pulsating plate column.
  # * Investigated the effect of frequency of pulsation, amplitude of pulsation and velocity of air on volumetric
# mass transfer coefficient for oxygen into CMC solutions of different concentrations.

# <h2>AWARDS AND ACHIEVEMENTS</h2>

# research allocation program funded by National Science Foundation (NSF).
# * **2019** MAE Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award, Department of MAE, UCSD.
# * **2016** Jacobs Fellow, UCSD by Jacobs school of Engineering.
# * **2016** Best M.S. (Engg) Thesis Award in Engineering Mechanics (R. Narasimha Award).
# * **2013** Junior Research Fellowship (JRF) awarded for graduate studies in India.
# * **2012** Summer Research Outreach Programme fellowship by Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore as
# a scholarship to carry out three months of research.
# * **2007** Merit scholarship and best outgoing student award for outstanding performance in the All
# India Secondary School Examination (AISSE).
